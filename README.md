# dotfiles

My config files to be able to recover it from all of my computers.

## Setup

To use the config, simply execute the `setup.sh` script:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PaloPil/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./setup.sh
```
and then enter your `sudo` password (to link `keyd` config, for instance)
